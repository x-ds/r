| As the title suggests, this will be a short lesson introducing you to graphics devices in<br>
| R. So, what IS a graphics device?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====                                                                              |   6%<br>
| Would you believe that it is something where you can make a plot appear, either a screen<br>
| device, such as a window on your computer, OR a file device?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======                                                                            |   9%<br>
| There are several different kinds of file devices with particular characteristics and<br>
| hence uses. These include PDF, PNG, JPEG, SVG, and TIFF. We'll talk more about these<br>
| later.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========                                                                         |  12%<br>
| To be clear, when you make a plot in R, it has to be "sent" to a specific graphics device.<br>
| Usually this is the screen (the default device), especially when you're doing exploratory<br>
| work. You'll send your plots to files when you're ready to publish a report, make a<br>
| presentation, or send info to colleagues.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                       |  15%<br>
| How you access your screen device depends on what computer system you're using. On a Mac<br>
| the screen device is launched with the call quartz(), on Windows you use the call<br>
| windows(), and on Unix/Linux x11().  On a given platform (Mac, Windows, Unix/Linux) there<br>
| is only one screen device, and obviously not all graphics devices are available on all<br>
| platforms (i.e. you cannot launch windows() on a Mac).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============                                                                    |  18%<br>
| Run the R command ?Devices to see what graphics devices are available on your system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?Devices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|=================                                                                  |  21%<br>
| R Documentation shows you what's available.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================                                                               |  24%<br>
| There are two basic approaches to plotting. The first, plotting to the screen, is the most<br>
| common. It's simple - you call a plotting function like plot, xyplot, or qplot (which you<br>
| call depends on the plotting system you favor, but that's another lesson), so that the<br>
| plot appears on the screen. Then you annotate (add to) the plot if necessary.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================                                                             |  26%<br>
| As an example, run the R command with with 2 arguments. The first is a dataset, faithful,<br>
| which comes with R, and the second is a call to the base plotting function plot. Your call<br>
| to plot should have two arguments, eruptions and waiting. Try this now to see what<br>
| happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with(faithful,plot(eruptions,waiting))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040470.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| Excellent job!</p>
<p>|========================                                                           |  29%<br>
| See how R created a scatterplot on the screen for you? This shows that relationship<br>
| between eruptions of the geyser Old Faithful and waiting time. Now use the R function<br>
| title with the argument main set equal to the string "Old Faithful Geyser data". This is<br>
| an annotation to the plot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>title(main="Old Faithful Geyser data")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040480.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|===========================                                                        |  32%<br>
| Simple, right?  Now run the command dev.cur(). This will show you the current plotting<br>
| device, the screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.cur()<br>
RStudioGD<br>
        2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>|=============================                                                      |  35%<br>
| The second way to create a plot is to send it to a file device. Depending on the type of<br>
| plot you're making, you explicitly launch a graphics device, e.g., a pdf file. Type the<br>
| command pdf(file="myplot.pdf") to launch the file device. This will create the pdf file<br>
| myplot.pdf in your working directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pdf(file="myplot.pdf")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Nice work!</p>
<p>|================================                                                   |  38%<br>
| You then call the plotting function (if you are using a file device, no plot will appear<br>
| on the screen). Run the with command again to plot the Old Faithful data. Use the up arrow<br>
| key to recover the command and save yourself some typing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with(faithful,plot(eruptions,waiting))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|==================================                                                 |  41%<br>
| Now rerun the title command and annotate the plot. (Up arrow keys are great!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>title(main="Old Faithful Geyser data")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are doing so well!</p>
<p>|=====================================                                              |  44%<br>
| Finally, when plotting to a file device, you have to close the device with the command<br>
| dev.off(). This is very important! Don't do it yet, though. After closing, you'll be able<br>
| to view the pdf file on your computer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================                                            |  47%<br>
| There are two basic types of file devices, vector and bitmap devices. These use different<br>
| formats and have different characteristics. Vector formats are good for line drawings and<br>
| plots with solid colors using a modest number of points, while bitmap formats are good for<br>
| plots with a large number of points, natural scenes or web-based plots.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================================                                         |  50%<br>
| We'll mention 4 specific vector formats. The first is pdf, which we've just used in our<br>
| example. This is useful for line-type graphics and papers. It resizes well, is usually<br>
| portable, but it is not efficient if a plot has many objects/points.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================                                       |  53%<br>
| The second is svg which is XML-based, scalable vector graphics. This supports animation<br>
| and interactivity and is potentially useful for web-based plots.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============================================                                     |  56%<br>
| The last two vector formats are win.metafile, a Windows-only metafile format, and<br>
| postscript (ps), an older format which also resizes well, is usually portable, and can be<br>
| used to create encapsulated postscript files. Unfortunately, Windows systems often don’t<br>
| have a postscript viewer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================================================                                  |  59%<br>
| We'll also mention 4 different bitmap formats. The first is png (Portable Network<br>
| Graphics) which is good for line drawings or images with solid colors. It uses lossless<br>
| compression (like the old GIF format), and most web browsers can read this format<br>
| natively. In addition, png is good for plots with many points, but it does not resize<br>
| well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================                                |  62%<br>
| In contrast, jpeg files are good for photographs or natural scenes. They use lossy<br>
| compression, so they're good for plots with many points. Files in jpeg format don't resize<br>
| well, but they can be read by almost any computer and any web browser. They're not great<br>
| for line drawings.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================================================                             |  65%<br>
| The last two bitmap formats are tiff, an older lossless compression meta-format and bmp<br>
| which is a native Windows bitmapped format.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========================================================                           |  68%<br>
| Although it is possible to open multiple graphics devices (screen, file, or both), when<br>
| viewing multiple plots at once, plotting can only occur on one graphics device at a time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================================================                        |  71%<br>
| The currently active graphics device can be found by calling dev.cur(). Try it now to see<br>
| what number is assigned to your pdf device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.cur()<br>
pdf<br>
  4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|=============================================================                      |  74%<br>
| Now use dev.off() to close the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.off()<br>
RStudioGD<br>
        2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>View <a href="../../files/f0040010.pdf" title="myplot.pdf">myplot.pdf</a></p>
<p>| You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|===============================================================                    |  76%<br>
| Now rerun dev.cur() to see what integer your plotting window is assigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.cur()<br>
RStudioGD<br>
        2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|==================================================================                 |  79%<br>
| The device is back to what it was when you started. As you might have guessed, every open<br>
| graphics device is assigned an integer greater than or equal to 2. You can change the<br>
| active graphics device with dev.set(<integer>) where <integer> is the number associated<br>
| with the graphics device you want to switch to.</integer></integer></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================================================================               |  82%<br>
| You can also copy a plot from one device to another. This can save you some time but<br>
| beware! Copying a plot is not an exact operation, so the result may not be identical to<br>
| the original. R provides some functions to help you do this. The function dev.copy copies<br>
| a plot from one device to another, and dev.copy2pdf specifically copies a plot to a PDF<br>
| file.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================================================            |  85%<br>
| Just for fun, rerun the with command again, with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)), to<br>
| plot the Old Faithful data. Use the up arrow key to recover the command if you don't feel<br>
| like typing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with(faithful,plot(eruptions,waiting))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|=========================================================================          |  88%<br>
| Now rerun the title command, title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data"), to annotate the<br>
| plot. (Up arrow keys are great!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>title(main="Old Faithful Geyser data")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|============================================================================       |  91%<br>
| Now run dev.copy with the 2 arguments. The first is png, and the second is file set equal<br>
| to "geyserplot.png". This will copy your screen plot to a png file in your working<br>
| directory which you can view AFTER you close the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.copy(png,"geyserplot.png")<br>
png<br>
  4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</p>
<p>| Type dev.copy(png, file = "geyserplot.png") at the command prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dev.copy(png,file="geyserplot.png")<br>
png<br>
  5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|==============================================================================     |  94%<br>
| Don't forget to close the PNG device! Do it NOW!!! Then you'll be able to view the file.</p>
<blockquote>
