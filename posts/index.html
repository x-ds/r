| In this lesson, we'll discuss why graphics are an important tool for data scientists and<br>
| the special role that exploratory graphs play in the field.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==                                                                                 |   3%<br>
| Which of the following would NOT be a good reason to use graphics in data science?</p>
<p>1: To understand data properties<br>
2: To find a color that best matches the shirt you're wearing<br>
3: To find patterns in data<br>
4: To suggest modeling strategies</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|===                                                                                |   4%<br>
| So graphics give us some visual form of data, and since our brains are very good at seeing<br>
| patterns, graphs give us a compact way to present data and find or display any pattern<br>
| that may be present.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====                                                                               |   5%<br>

<p>1: To err is human, to forgive divine<br>

3: A picture is worth a 1000 words<br>
4: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|======                                                                             |   7%<br>
| Exploratory graphs serve mostly the same functions as graphs. They help us find patterns<br>
| in data and understand its properties. They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug<br>
| analyses. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======                                                                            |   8%<br>
| Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in an investigation, the "quick and<br>
| dirty" tool used to point the data scientist in a fruitful direction. A scientist might<br>
| need to make a lot of exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal understanding of<br>
| the problem being studied. Plot details such as axes, legends, color and size are cleaned<br>
| up later to convey more information in an aesthetically pleasing way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========                                                                           |   9%<br>
| To demonstrate these ideas, we've copied some data for you from the U.S. Environmental<br>
| Protection Agency (EPA) which sets national ambient air quality standards for outdoor air<br>
| pollution. These Standards say that for fine particle pollution (PM2.5), the "annual mean,<br>
| averaged over 3 years" cannot exceed 12 micro grams per cubic meter. We stored the data<br>
| from the U.S. EPA web site in the data frame pollution. Use the R function head to see the<br>
| first few entries of pollution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>head(pollution)<br>
       pm25  fips region longitude latitude<br>
1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278<br>
2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581<br>
3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148<br>
4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913<br>
5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860<br>
6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|=========                                                                          |  11%<br>
| We see right away that there's at least one county exceeding the EPA's standard of 12<br>
| micrograms per cubic meter. What else do we see?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========                                                                         |  12%<br>
| We see 5 columns of data. The pollution count is in the first column labeled pm25. We'll<br>
| work mostly with that. The other 4 columns are a fips code indicating the state (first 2<br>
| digits) and county (last 3 digits) with that count, the associated region (east or west),<br>
| and the longitude and latitude of the area. Now run the R command dim with pollution as an<br>
| argument to see how long the table is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dim(pollution)<br>
[1] 576   5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Great job!</p>
<p>|===========                                                                        |  13%<br>
| So there are 576 entries in pollution. We'd like to investigate the question "Are there<br>
| any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard (12 micro grams per cubic<br>
| meter) for fine particle pollution?" We'll look at several one dimensional summaries of<br>
| the data to investigate this question.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                       |  15%<br>
| The first technique uses the R command summary, a 5-number summary which returns 6<br>
| numbers. Run it now with the pm25 column of pollution as its argument. Recall that the<br>
| construct for this is pollution$pm25.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>summary(pollution$pm25)<br>
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.<br>
  3.383   8.549  10.047   9.836  11.356  18.441</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are doing so well!</p>
<p>|=============                                                                      |  16%<br>
| This shows us basic info about the pm25 data, namely its Minimum (0 percentile) and<br>
| Maximum (100 percentile) values, and three Quartiles of the data. These last indicate the<br>
| pollution measures at which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the counties fall below. In addition to<br>
| these 5 numbers we see the Mean or average measure of particulate pollution across the 576<br>
| counties.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============                                                                     |  17%<br>
| Half the measured counties have a pollution level less than or equal to what number of<br>
| micrograms per cubic meter?</p>
<p>1: 10.050<br>
2: 9.836<br>
3: 8.549<br>
4: 11.360</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>

| To save you a lot of typing we've saved off pollution$pm25 for you in the variable ppm.<br>
| You can use ppm now in place of the longer expression. Try it now as the argument of the R<br>
| command quantile. See how the results look a lot like the results of the output of the<br>
| summary command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>quantile(ppm)<br>
       0%       25%       50%       75%      100%<br>
 3.382626  8.548799 10.046697 11.356012 18.440731</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|=================                                                                  |  20%<br>
| See how the results are similar to those returned by summary? Quantile gives the<br>
| quartiles, right? What is the one value missing from this quantile output that summary<br>
| gave you?</p>
<p>1: the maximum value<br>
2: the median<br>
3: the minimum value<br>
4: the mean</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|==================                                                                 |  21%<br>
| Now we'll plot a picture, specifically a boxplot. Run the R command boxplot with ppm as an<br>
| input. Also specify the color parameter col equal to "blue".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boxplot(ppm,col="blue")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040290.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|===================                                                                |  23%<br>
| The boxplot shows us the same quartile data that summary and quantile did. The lower and<br>
| upper edges of the blue box respectively show the values of the 25% and 75% quantiles.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================                                                               |  24%<br>
| What do you think the horizontal line inside the box represents?</p>
<p>1: the maximum value<br>
2: the mean<br>
3: the minimum value<br>
4: the median</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| Nice work!</p>
<p>|=====================                                                              |  25%<br>
| The "whiskers" of the box (the vertical lines extending above and below the box) relate to<br>
| the range parameter of boxplot, which we let default to the value 1.5 used by R. The<br>
| height of the box is the interquartile range, the difference between the 75th and 25th<br>
| quantiles. In this case that difference is 2.8. The whiskers are drawn to be a length of<br>
| range<em>2.8 or 1.5</em>2.8. This shows us roughly how many, if any, data points are outliers,<br>
| that is, beyond this range of values.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================                                                             |  27%<br>
| Note that boxplot is part of R's base plotting package. A nice feature that this package<br>
| provides is its ability to overlay features. That is, you can add to (annotate) an<br>
| existing plot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================                                                            |  28%<br>
| To see this, run the R command abline with the argument h equal to 12. Recall that 12 is<br>
| the EPA standard for air quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>abline(h=12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040300.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|========================                                                           |  29%<br>
| What do you think this command did?</p>
<p>1: drew a horizontal line at 12<br>
2: hid 12 random data points<br>
3: drew a vertical line at 12<br>
4: nothing</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=========================                                                          |  31%<br>
| So abline "adds one or more straight lines through the current plot." We see from the plot<br>
| that the bulk of the measured counties comply with the standard since they fall under the<br>
| line marking that standard.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================                                                        |  32%<br>
| Now use the R command hist (another function from the base package) with the argument ppm.<br>
| Specify the color parameter col equal to "green". This will plot a histogram of the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(ppm,col="green")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040310.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|============================                                                       |  33%<br>
| The histogram gives us a little more detailed information about our data, specifically the<br>
| distribution of the pollution counts, or how many counties fall into each bucket of<br>
| measurements.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================                                                      |  35%<br>
| What are the most frequent pollution counts?</p>
<p>1: between 9 and 12<br>
2: between 12 and 14<br>
3: between 6 and 8<br>
4: under 5</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|==============================                                                     |  36%<br>
| Now run the R command rug with the argument ppm.</p>
<blockquote>

| This one-dimensional plot, with its grayscale representation, gives you a little more<br>
| detailed information about how many data points are in each bucket and where they lie<br>
| within the bucket. It shows (through density of tick marks) that the greatest<br>

| histogram did.</p>

| To illustrate this a little more, we've defined for you two vectors, high and low,<br>

| Again, we see one data point greater than 18, one between 17 and 18, several between 16<br>
| and 17 and two between 15 and 16, verifying what rug indicated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================                                                |  43%<br>

<p>|=====================================                                              |  44%<br>
| What do you think the breaks argument specifies in this case?</p>
<p>1: the number of data points to graph<br>
2: the number of counties exceeding the EPA standard<br>
3: the number of buckets to split the data into<br>

| So this histogram with more buckets is not nearly as smooth as the preceding one. In fact,<br>
| it's a little too noisy to see the distribution clearly. When you're plotting histograms<br>
| you might have to experiment with the argument breaks to get a good idea of your data's<br>

<p>|===========================================                                        |  52%<br>
| Better, right? Thicker and more of a contrast in color. This shows that although the<br>
| median (50%) is below the standard, there are a fair number of counties in the U.S that<br>
| have pollution levels higher than the standard.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================                                       |  53%<br>
| Now recall that our pollution data had 5 columns of information. So far we've only looked<br>
| at the pm25 column. We can also look at other information. To remind yourself what's there<br>
| run the R command names with pollution as the argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>names(pollution)<br>
[1] "pm25"      "fips"      "region"    "longitude" "latitude"</p>

<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=============================================                                      |  55%<br>
| Longitude and latitude don't sound interesting, and each fips is unique since it<br>
| identifies states (first 2 digits) and counties (last 3 digits). Let's look at the region<br>
| column to see what's there. Run the R command table on this column. Use the construct<br>
| pollution$region. Store the result in the variable reg.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reg&lt;-table(pollution$region)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|==============================================                                     |  56%<br>
| Look at reg now.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>|================================================                                   |  57%<br>
| Lot more counties in the east than west. We'll use the R command barplot (another type of<br>
| one-dimensional summary) to plot this information. Call barplot with reg as its first<br>
| argument, the argument col equal to "wheat", and the argument main equal to the string<br>
| "Number of Counties in Each Region".</p>

<p>|==================================================                                 |  60%<br>
| So we've seen several examples of one-dimensional graphs that summarize data. Two<br>
| dimensional graphs include scatterplots, multiple graphs which we'll see more examples of,<br>
| and overlayed one-dimensional plots which the R packages such as lattice and ggplot2<br>
| provide.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================                                |  61%<br>
| Some graphs have more than two-dimensions. These include overlayed or multiple<br>
| two-dimensional plots and spinning plots. Some three-dimensional plots are tricky to<br>
| understand so have limited applications. We'll see some examples now of more complicated<br>
| graphs, in particular, we'll show two graphs together.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================================================                               |  63%<br>
| First we'll show how R, in one line and using base plotting, can display multiple<br>
| boxplots. We simply specify that we want to see the pollution data as a function of<br>
| region. We know that our pollution data characterized each of the 576 entries as belonging<br>
| to one of two regions (east and west).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================================                              |  64%<br>
| We use the R formula y ~ x to show that y (in this case pm25) depends on x (region). Since<br>
| both come from the same data frame (pollution) we can specify a data argument set equal to<br>
| pollution. By doing this, we don't have to type pollution$pm25 (or ppm) and  
| pollution$region. We can just specify the formula pm25~region. Call boxplot now with this<br>
| formula as its argument, data equal to pollution, and col equal to "red".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boxplot(pm25~region,data=pollution,col="red")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040380.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| Perseverance, that's the answer.</p>
<p>|======================================================                             |  65%<br>
| Two for the price of one! Similarly we can plot multiple histograms in one plot, though to<br>
| do this we have to use more than one R command. First we have to set up the plot window<br>
| with the R command par which specifies how we want to lay out the plots, say one above the<br>
| other. We also use par to specify margins, a 4-long vector which indicates the number of<br>
| lines for the bottom, left, top and right. Type the R command<br>
| par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1)) now. Don't expect to see any new result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|=======================================================                            |  67%<br>
| So we set up the plot window for two rows and one column with the mfrow argument. The mar<br>
| argument set up the margins. Before we plot the histograms let's explore the R command<br>
| subset which, not surprisingly, "returns subsets of vectors, matrices or data frames which<br>
| meet conditions". We'll use subset to pull off the data we want to plot. Call subset now<br>
| with pollution as its first argument and a boolean expression testing region for equality<br>
| with the string "east". Put the result in the variable east.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>east&lt;-subset(pollution,region=="east")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Keep working like that and you'll get there!</p>
<p>|========================================================                           |  68%<br>
| Use head to look at the first few entries of east.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>head(east)<br>
       pm25  fips region longitude latitude<br>
1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278<br>
2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581<br>
3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148<br>
4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913<br>
5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860<br>
6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|==========================================================                         |  69%<br>
| So east holds more information than we need. We just want to plot a histogram with the<br>
| pm25 portion. Call hist now with the pm25 portion of east as its first argument and col<br>
| equal to "green" as its second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(east$pm25,col="green")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040390.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|===========================================================                        |  71%<br>
| See? The command par told R we were going to have one column with 2 rows, so it placed<br>
| this histogram in the top position.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================                       |  72%<br>
| Now, here's a challenge for you. Plot the histogram of the counties from the west using<br>
| just one R command. Let the appropriate subset command (with the pm25 portion specified)<br>
| be the first argument and col (equal to "green") the second.  To cut down on your typing,<br>
| use the up arrow key to get your last command and replace "east" with the subset command.<br>
| Make sure the boolean argument checks for equality between region and "west".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(subset(pollution,region=="west")$pm25,col="green")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040400.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|=============================================================                      |  73%<br>
| See how R does all the labeling for you? Notice that the titles are different since we<br>
| used different commands for the two plots. Let's look at some scatter plots now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============================================================                     |  75%<br>
| Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots which show the relationship between two variables,<br>
| usually x and y. Let's look at a scatterplot showing the relationship between latitude and<br>
| the pm25 data. We'll use plot, a function from R's base plotting package.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============================================================                    |  76%<br>
| We've seen that we can use a function call as an argument when calling another function.<br>
| We'll do this again when we call plot with the arguments latitude and pm25 which are both<br>
| from our data frame pollution. We'll call plot from inside the R command with which<br>
| evaluates "an R expression in an environment constructed from data". We'll use pollution<br>
| as the first argument to with and the call to plot as the second. This allows us to avoid<br>
| typing "pollution$" before the arguments to plot, so it saves us some typing and adds to<br>
| your base of R knowledge. Try this now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with(pollution,plot(latitude,pm25))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040410.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|================================================================                   |  77%<br>
| Note that the first argument is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the y. Now<br>
| use abline to add a horizontal line at 12. Use two additional arguments, lwd equal to 2<br>
| and lty also equal to 2. See what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>abline(h=12,lwd=2,lty=2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040420.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|=================================================================                  |  79%<br>
| See how lty=2 made the line dashed? Now let's replot the scatterplot. This time, instead<br>
| of using with, call plot directly with 3 arguments. The first 2 are pollution$latitude and  
| ppm. The third argument, col, we'll use to add color and more information to our plot. Set  
| this argument (col) equal to pollution$region and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plot(pollution$latitude,ppm,col=pollution$region)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040430.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| Perseverance, that's the answer.</p>
<p>|==================================================================                 |  80%<br>
| We've got two colors on the map to distinguish between counties in the east and those in<br>
| the west. Can we figure out which color is east and which west? See that the high (greater<br>
| than 50) and low (less than 25) latitudes are both red. Latitudes indicate distance from<br>
| the equator, so which half of the U.S. (east or west) has counties at the extreme north<br>
| and south?</p>
<p>1: east<br>

| We see many counties are above the healthy standard set by the EPA, but it's hard to tell<br>
| overall, which region, east or west, is worse.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================================================================             |  84%<br>
| Let's plot two scatterplots distinguished by region.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================================================            |  85%<br>
| As we did with multiple histograms, we first have to set up the plot window with the R<br>
| command par. This time, let's plot the scatterplots side by side (one row and two<br>
| columns). We also need to use different margins. Type the R command par(mfrow = c(1, 2),<br>
| mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1)) now. Don't expect to see any new result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>par(mfrow = c(1, 2),mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))</p>

<p>| You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|========================================================================           |  87%<br>
| For the first scatterplot, on the left, we'll plot the latitudes and pm25 counts from the<br>
| west. We already pulled out the information for the counties in the east. Let's now get<br>
| the information for the counties from the west. Create the variable west by using the<br>
| subset command with pollution as the first argument and the appropriate boolean as the<br>
| second.</p>

| In this lesson, we'll discuss some basic principles of presenting data effectively. These<br>
| will illustrate some fundamental concepts of displaying results in order to make them more<br>
| meaningful and convincing. These principles are cribbed from Edward Tufte's great 2006<br>
| book, Beautiful Evidence. You can read more about them at the www.edwardtufte.com website.</p>

<p>|=====                                                                              |   6%<br>
| As a warm-up, which of the following would NOT be a good use of analytic graphing?</p>
<p>1: To show causality, mechanism, explanation<br>
2: To show multivariate data<br>
3: To decide which horse to bet on at the track<br>
4: To show comparisons</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=======                                                                            |   8%<br>
| You're ready to start. Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of<br>
| analytic graphs is to show some comparison. You'll hear more about this when you study<br>
| statistical inference (another great course BTW), but evidence for a hypothesis is always<br>
| relative to another competing or alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========                                                                          |  11%<br>
| When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to<br>
| What?" This is why in commercials you often hear the phrase "other leading brands". An<br>
| implicit comparison, right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                       |  14%<br>
| Consider this boxplot which shows the relationship between the use of an air cleaner and<br>
| the number of symptom-free days of asthmatic children. (The top and bottom lines of the<br>
| box indicate the 25% and 75% quartiles of the data, and the horizontal line in the box<br>
| shows the 50%.) Since the box is above 0, the number of symptom-free days for children<br>
| with asthma is bigger using the air cleaner. This is good, right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040230.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============                                                                     |  17%<br>
| How many days of improvement does the median correspond to?</p>
<p>1: 4<br>
2: -2<br>
3: 1<br>
4: 12</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|================                                                                   |  19%<br>
| While it's somewhat informative, it's also somewhat cryptic, since the y-axis is claiming<br>
| to show a change in number of symptom-free days. Wouldn't it be better to show a<br>
| comparison?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==================                                                                 |  22%<br>
| Like this? Here's a graphic which shows two boxplots, the one on the left showing the<br>
| results for a control group that doesn't use an air cleaner alongside the previously shown<br>
| boxplot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================                                                              |  25%<br>
| By showing the two boxplots side by side, you can clearly see that using the air cleaner<br>
| increases the number of symptom-free days for most asthmatic children. The plot on the<br>
| right (using the air cleaner) is generally higher than the one on the left (the control<br>
| group).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040240.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|=======================                                                            |  28%<br>
| What does this graph NOT show you?</p>
<p>1: Half the chidren in the control group had no improvement<br>
2: Children in the control group had at most 3 symptom-free days<br>
3: 75% of the children using the air cleaner had at most 3 symptom-free days<br>
4: Using the air cleaner makes asthmatic children sicker</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|=========================                                                          |  31%<br>
| So the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality<br>
| or a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or systematic<br>
| structure shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're trying to<br>
| answer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================                                                       |  33%<br>
| Consider this plot which shows the dual boxplot we just showed, but next to it we have a<br>
| corresponding plot of changes in measures of particulate matter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040250.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============================                                                     |  36%<br>
| This picture tries to explain how the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free<br>
| days for asthmatic children. What mechanism does the graph imply?</p>
<p>1: That the air cleaner increases pollution<br>
2: That the air cleaner reduces pollution<br>
3: That the children in the control group are healthier<br>
4: That the air in the control group is cleaner than the air in the other group</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|================================                                                   |  39%<br>
| By showing the two sets of boxplots side by side you're explaining your theory of why the<br>
| air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days. Onward!</p>

| So the first principle was to show some comparison, the second was to show a mechanism, so<br>
| what will the third principle say to show?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================                                              |  44%<br>

<p>|=======================================                                            |  47%<br>
| What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this term<br>
| means more than 2 variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.<br>
| Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations<br>
| of lines? They're valuable, but usually questions are more complicated and require more<br>
| variables.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================================                                         |  50%<br>
| Sometimes, if you restrict yourself to two variables you'll be misled and draw an<br>
| incorrect conclusion.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================                                       |  53%<br>
| Consider this plot which shows the relationship between air pollution (x-axis) and<br>
| mortality rates among the elderly (y-axis). The blue regression line shows a surprising<br>
| result. (You'll learn about regression lines when you take the fabulous Regression Models<br>
| course.)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040260.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============================================                                     |  56%<br>
| What does the blue regression line indicate?</p>
<p>1: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more<br>
2: As pollution increases fewer people die<br>
3: As pollution increases the number of deaths doesn't change<br>
4: As pollution increases more people die</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| Excellent job!</p>
<p>|================================================                                   |  58%<br>
| Fewer deaths with more pollution? That's a surprise! Something's gotta be wrong, right? In<br>
| fact, this is an example of Simpson's paradox, or the Yule–Simpson effect. Wikipedia<br>
| (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox</a>) tells us that this "is a paradox in<br>
| probability and statistics, in which a trend that appears in different groups of data<br>
| disappears when these groups are combined."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================                                |  61%<br>
| Suppose we divided this mortality/pollution data into the four seasons. Would we see<br>
| different trends?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================================                              |  64%<br>
| Yes, we do! Plotting the same data for the 4 seasons individually we see a different<br>
| result.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040270.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|=======================================================                            |  67%<br>
| What does the new plot indicate?</p>
<p>1: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more<br>
2: As pollution increases the seasons change<br>
3: As pollution increases more people die in all seasons<br>
4: As pollution increases fewer people die in all seasons</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|==========================================================                         |  69%<br>
| The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not<br>
| limiting yourself to one form of expression. You can use words, numbers, images as well as<br>
| diagrams. Graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation. Remember, "Don't<br>
| let the tool drive the analysis!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================                       |  72%<br>
| To show you what we mean, here's an example of a figure taken from a paper published in<br>
| the Journal of the AMA. It shows the relationship between pollution and hospitalization of<br>
| people with heart disease. As you can see, it's a lot different from our previous plots.<br>
| The solid circles in the center portion indicate point estimates of percentage changes in<br>
| hospitalization rates for different levels of pollution. The lines through the circles<br>
| indicate confidence intervals associated with these estimates. (You'll learn more about<br>
| confidence intervals in another great course, the one on statistical inference.)</p>
<p><img src="../images/r0040280.png" alt="graph" title="graph"><br>
...</p>
<p>|==============================================================                     |  75%<br>
| Note that on the right side of the figure is another column of numbers, one for each of<br>
| the point estimates given. This column shows posterior probabilities that relative risk is<br>
| greater than 0. This, in effect, is a measure of the strength of the evidence showing the<br>
| correlation between pollution and hospitalization.  The point here is that all of this<br>
| information is located in one picture so that the reader can see the strength of not only<br>
| the correlations but the evidence as well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================================================================                  |  78%<br>
| The fifth principle of graphing involves describing and documenting the evidence with<br>
| sources and appropriate labels and scales. Credibility is important so the data graphics<br>
| should tell a complete story. Also, using R, you want to preserve any code you use to<br>
| generate your data and graphics so that the research can be replicated if necessary. This<br>
| allows for easy verification or finding bugs in your analysis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================================                |  81%<br>
| The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is<br>
| king! If you don't have something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you.<br>
| Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and<br>
| integrity of their content.</p>

| The author of tidyr, Hadley Wickham, discusses his philosophy of tidy data in his 'Tidy<br>
| Data' paper:<br>
|<br>
| <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf</a><br>

| This paper should be required reading for anyone who works with data, but it's not<br>
| required in order to complete this lesson.</p>

| Tidy data is formatted in a standard way that facilitates exploration and analysis and<br>
| works seamlessly with other tidy data tools. Specifically, tidy data satisfies three<br>
| conditions:<br>
|<br>
| 1) Each variable forms a column<br>
|<br>
| 2) Each observation forms a row<br>
|<br>
| 3) Each type of observational unit forms a table</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======                                                                         |   9%<br>
| Any dataset that doesn't satisfy these conditions is considered 'messy' data.<br>
| Therefore, all of the following are characteristics of messy data, EXCEPT...</p>
<p>1: Variables are stored in both rows and columns<br>
2: Column headers are values, not variable names<br>
3: Every column contains a different variable<br>
4: Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table<br>
5: Multiple variables are stored in one column<br>
6: A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables</p>

| The first column represents each of five possible grades that students could receive<br>

| This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count. The first variable,<br>
| grade, is already a column, so that should remain as it is. The second variable, sex,<br>
| is captured by the second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is the<br>

| Each row of the data now represents exactly one observation, characterized by a unique<br>
| combination of the grade and sex variables. Each of our variables (grade, sex, and<br>

| It's important to understand what each argument to gather() means. The data argument,<br>
| students, gives the name of the original dataset. The key and value arguments -- sex<br>
| and count, respectively -- give the column names for our tidy dataset. The final<br>
| argument, -grade, says that we want to gather all columns EXCEPT the grade column<br>
| (since grade is already a proper column variable.)</p>

| The second messy data case we'll look at is when multiple variables are stored in one<br>

| This dataset is similar to the first, except now there are two separate classes, 1 and<br>
| 2, and we have total counts for each sex within each class. students2 suffers from the<br>

| In the last lesson, you learned about the five main data manipulation 'verbs' in dplyr:<br>
| select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), and summarize(). The last of these,<br>
| summarize(), is most powerful when applied to grouped data.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===                                                                             |   4%<br>
| The main idea behind grouping data is that you want to break up your dataset into<br>
| groups of rows based on the values of one or more variables. The group_by() function is<br>
| reponsible for doing this.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====                                                                           |   6%<br>
| We'll continue where we left off with RStudio's CRAN download log from July 8, 2014,<br>
| which contains information on roughly 225,000 R package downloads<br>
| (<a href="http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/">http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/</a>).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======                                                                          |   8%<br>
| As with the last lesson, the dplyr package was automatically installed (if necessary)<br>
| and loaded at the beginning of this lesson. Normally, this is something you would have<br>
| to do on your own. Just to build the habit, type library(dplyr) now to load the package<br>
| again.</p>

| I've made the dataset available to you in a data frame called mydf. Put it in a 'data<br>
| frame tbl' using the tbl_df() function and store the result in a object called cran. If<br>
| you're not sure what I'm talking about, you should start with the previous lesson.<br>
| Otherwise, practice makes perfect!</p>

| The 'count' column, created with n(), contains the total number of rows (i.e.<br>
| downloads) for each package. The 'unique' column, created with n_distinct(ip_id), gives<br>
| the total number of unique downloads for each package, as measured by the number of<br>
| distinct ip_id's. The 'countries' column, created with n_distinct(country), provides<br>
| the number of countries in which each package was downloaded. And finally, the<br>
| 'avg_bytes' column, created with mean(size), contains the mean download size (in bytes)<br>
| for each package.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================                                                    |  35%<br>
| It's important that you understand how each column of pack_sum was created and what it<br>
| means. Now that we've summarized the data by individual packages, let's play around<br>
| with it some more to see what we can learn.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================                                                   |  37%<br>
| Naturally, we'd like to know which packages were most popular on the day these data<br>
| were collected (July 8, 2014). Let's start by isolating the top 1% of packages, based<br>
| on the total number of downloads as measured by the 'count' column.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============================                                                 |  38%<br>
| We need to know the value of 'count' that splits the data into the top 1% and bottom<br>
| 99% of packages based on total downloads. In statistics, this is called the 0.99, or<br>
| 99%, sample quantile. Use quantile(pack_sum$count, probs = 0.99) to determine this<br>
| number.</p>

| In this script, we've used a special chaining operator, %&gt;%, which was originally<br>
| introduced in the magrittr R package and has now become a key component of dplyr. You<br>
| can pull up the related documentation with ?chain. The benefit of %&gt;% is that it allows<br>
| us to chain the function calls in a linear fashion. The code to the right of %&gt;%<br>
| operates on the result from the code to the left of %&gt;%.<br>
|<br>
| Once again, just try to understand the code, then type submit() to continue.</p>

<pre><code>{r}
# Read the code below, but don't change anything. As
# you read it, you can pronounce the %&gt;% operator as
# the word 'then'.
#
# Type submit() when you think you understand
# everything here.

# 3. package
# 4. size
#
# The call to print() at the end of the chain is optional,

# to print(), you can leave off the parentheses after
# the function name. This is a convenient feature of the %&gt;%
# operator.

<p>| In this lesson, you'll learn how to manipulate data using dplyr. dplyr is a fast and<br>
| powerful R package written by Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois that provides a<br>
| consistent and concise grammar for manipulating tabular data.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=                                                                               |   2%<br>
| One unique aspect of dplyr is that the same set of tools allow you to work with tabular<br>
| data from a variety of sources, including data frames, data tables, databases and<br>
| multidimensional arrays. In this lesson, we'll focus on data frames, but everything you<br>
| learn will apply equally to other formats.</p>

| The first step of working with data in dplyr is to load the data into what the package<br>

| The first thing to notice is that we don't have to type cran$ip_id, cran$package, and<br>

| Again, note that filter() recognizes 'package' as a column of cran, without you having<br>
| to explicitly specify cran$package.</p>

<p>|=========================================                                       |  52%<br>
| The == operator asks whether the thing on the left is equal to the thing on the right.<br>
| If yes, then it returns TRUE. If no, then FALSE. In this case, package is an entire<br>
| vector (column) of values, so package == "swirl" returns a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs.<br>
| filter() then returns only the rows of cran corresponding to the TRUEs.</p>

| You can specify as many conditions as you want, separated by commas. For example<br>
| filter(cran, r_version == "3.1.1", country == "US") will return all rows of cran<br>

| We've seen how to select a subset of columns and rows from our dataset using select()<br>
| and filter(), respectively. Inherent in select() was also the ability to arrange our<br>

<p>|=========================================================                       |  72%<br>
| To see how arrange() works, let's first take a subset of cran. select() all columns<br>

| Now, to order the ROWS of cran2 so that ip_id is in ascending order (from small to<br>
| large), type arrange(cran2, ip_id). You may want to make your console wide enough so<br>
| that you can see ip_id, which is the last column.</p>

<p><strong>Data</strong><br>
The zip file containing the data can be downloaded here:</p>
<p><a href="http://link.datascience.eu.org/p004d1">AirPollution.zip</a> (2.67MB)</p>
<p>The zip file contains 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files containing pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution at 332 locations in the United States. Each file contains data from a single monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name. For example, data for monitor 200 is contained in the file "200.csv". Each file contains three variables:</p>
<p>Date: the date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format (year-month-day)<br>
sulfate: the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)<br>
nitrate: the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)</p>
<p>This data will be used in the following functions. The goal is load data from these files without dowloading or storing them in the hard disk drive, but be available to the functions to woek on them.</p>

<p>| One of the greatest strengths of R, relative to other programming languages, is the<br>
| ease with which we can create publication-quality graphics. In this lesson, you'll<br>
| learn about base graphics in R.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==                                                                              |   2%<br>
| We do not cover the more advanced portions of graphics in R in this lesson. These<br>
| include lattice, ggplot2 and ggvis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===                                                                             |   4%<br>
| There is a school of thought that this approach is backwards, that we should teach<br>
| ggplot2 first. See <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/">http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/</a> for an<br>
| outline of this view.</p>

| To fix ideas, we will work with simple data frames. Our main goal is to introduce<br>
| various plotting functions and their arguments. All the output would look more<br>

<p>...</p>
<p>|=========                                                                       |  11%<br>

| As you can see in the help page, the cars data set has only two variables: speed and<br>
| stopping distance. Note that the data is from the 1920s.</p>

| As always, R tries very hard to give you something sensible given the information that<br>
| you have provided to it. First, R notes that the data frame you have given it has just<br>
| two columns, so it assumes that you want to plot one column versus the other.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================                                                             |  24%<br>
| Second, since we do not provide labels for either axis, R uses the names of the<br>
| columns. Third, it creates axis tick marks at nice round numbers and labels them<br>
| accordingly. Fourth, it uses the other defaults supplied in plot().</p>
<p>...</p>

| The help page for plot() highlights the different arguments that the function can take.<br>
| The two most important are x and y, the variables that will be plotted. For the next<br>
| set of questions, include the argument names in your answers. That is, do not type<br>
| plot(cars$speed, cars$dist), although that will work. Instead use plot(x = cars$speed,

| Note that this produces a slightly different answer than plot(cars). In this case, R is<br>

| Note that there are other ways to call the plot command, i.e., using the "formula"<br>
| interface. For example, we get a similar plot to the above with plot(dist ~ speed,<br>
| cars). However, we will wait till later in the lesson before using the formula<br>
| interface.</p>

| Continue using plot(cars, ...) as the base answer to these questions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==================================================                              |  63%<br>

| Plot cars while limiting the x-axis to 10 through 15.  (Use xlim = c(10, 15) to achieve<br>

<p>| All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|=========================================================                       |  72%<br>
| Arguments like "col" and "pch" may not seem very intuitive. And that is because they<br>
| aren't! So, many/most people use more modern packages, like ggplot2, for creating their<br>
| graphics in R.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================================================                     |  74%<br>
| It is, however, useful to have an introduction to base graphics because many of the<br>
| idioms in lattice and ggplot2 are modeled on them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================================================                   |  76%<br>
| Let's now look at some other functions in base graphics that may be useful, starting<br>
| with boxplots.</p>

| Load the mtcars data frame.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>| You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|================================================================                |  80%<br>
| Anytime that you load up a new data frame, you should explore it before using it. In<br>
| the middle of a swirl lesson, just type play(). This temporarily suspends the lesson<br>
| (without losing the work you have already done) and allows you to issue commands like<br>
| dim(mtcars) and head(mtcars). Once you are done examining the data, just type nxt() and<br>
| the lesson will pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==================================================================              |  83%<br>
| Look up the help page for boxplot().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?boxplot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent job!</p>
<p>|====================================================================            |  85%<br>
| Instead of adding data columns directly as input arguments, as we did with plot(), it<br>
| is often handy to pass in the entire data frame. This is what the "data" argument in<br>
| boxplot() allows.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================================================================          |  87%<br>
| boxplot(), like many R functions, also takes a "formula" argument, generally an<br>
| expression with a tilde ("~") which indicates the relationship between the input<br>
| variables. This allows you to enter something like mpg ~ cyl to plot the relationship<br>
| between cyl (number of cylinders) on the x-axis and mpg (miles per gallon) on the<br>
| y-axis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================================================         |  89%<br>
| Use boxplot() with formula = mpg ~ cyl and data = mtcars to create a box plot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boxplot(formula=mpg~cyl,data=mtcars)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040160.png" alt="boxplot(formula=mpg~cyl,data=mtcars)" title="boxplot(formula=mpg~cyl,data=mtcars)"></p>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|=========================================================================       |  91%<br>
| The plot shows that mpg is much lower for cars with more cylinders. Note that we can<br>
| use the same set of arguments that we explored with plot() above to add axis labels,<br>
| titles and so on.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================================================================     |  93%<br>
| When looking at a single variable, histograms are a useful tool. hist() is the<br>
| associated R function. Like plot(), hist() is best used by just passing in a single<br>
| vector.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================================================================   |  96%<br>
| Use hist() with the vector mtcars$mpg to create a histogram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(mtcars$mpg)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/r0040170.png" alt="hist(mtcars$mpg)" title="hist(mtcars$mpg)"></p>
<p>| You are doing so well!</p>
<p>|==============================================================================  |  98%<br>

| What if we need to reference a date prior to 1970-01-01? Create a variable d2<br>
| containing as.Date("1969-01-01").</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d2&lt;-as.Date("1969-01-01")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|==================                                                              |  22%<br>
| Now use unclass() again to see what d2 looks like internally.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|====================                                                            |  25%<br>
| As you may have anticipated, you get a negative number. In this case, it's -365, since<br>
| 1969-01-01 is exactly one calendar year (i.e. 365 days) BEFORE 1970-01-01.</p>
<p>...</p>

| Now, let's take a look at how R stores times. You can access the current date and time<br>
| using the Sys.time() function with no arguments. Do this and store the result in a<br>
| variable called t1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t1&lt;-Sys.time()</p>

<p>| You're the best!</p>

| As mentioned earlier, POSIXct is just one of two ways that R represents time<br>
| information. (You can ignore the second value above, POSIXt, which just functions as a<br>
| common language between POSIXct and POSIXlt.) Use unclass() to see what t1 looks like<br>
| internally -- the (large) number of seconds since the beginning of 1970.</p>

<p>| You got it right!</p>
<p>|===============================                                                 |  39%<br>
| By default, Sys.time() returns an object of class POSIXct, but we can coerce the result<br>
| to POSIXlt with as.POSIXlt(Sys.time()). Give it a try and store the result in t2.</p>

| Now that we have explored all three types of date and time objects, let's look at a few<br>
| functions that extract useful information from any of these objects -- weekdays(),<br>
| months(), and quarters().</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============================================                                 |  58%<br>
| The weekdays() function will return the day of week from any date or time object. Try<br>
| it out on d1, which is the Date object that contains today's date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>weekdays(d1)<br>
[1] "Wednesday"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Perseverance, that's the answer.</p>
<p>|=================================================                               |  61%<br>
| The months() function also works on any date or time object. Try it on t1, which is the<br>
| POSIXct object that contains the current time (well, it was the current time when you<br>
| created it).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>months(t1)<br>
[1] "April"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent job!</p>
<p>|===================================================                             |  64%<br>
| The quarters() function returns the quarter of the year (Q1-Q4) from any date or time<br>
| object. Try it on t2, which is the POSIXlt object that contains the time at which you<br>
| created it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>quarters(t2)<br>
[1] "Q2"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|=====================================================                           |  67%<br>
| Often, the dates and times in a dataset will be in a format that R does not recognize.<br>
| The strptime() function can be helpful in this situation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========================================================                        |  69%<br>
| strptime() converts character vectors to POSIXlt. In that sense, it is similar to<br>
| as.POSIXlt(), except that the input doesn't have to be in a particular format<br>
| (YYYY-MM-DD).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================================================                      |  72%<br>
| To see how it works, store the following character string in a variable called t3:<br>
| "October 17, 1986 08:24" (with the quotes).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t3&lt;-"October 17, 1986 08:24"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Keep working like that and you'll get there!</p>
<p>|============================================================                    |  75%<br>
| Now, use strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M") to help R convert our date/time object to a<br>
| format that it understands. Assign the result to a new variable called t4. (You should<br>
| pull up the documentation for strptime() if you'd like to know more about how it<br>
| works.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")<br>
[1] "1986-10-17 08:24:00 IST"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</p>
<p>| t4 &lt;- strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M") will convert our date/time object to a format<br>
| that R understands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t4&lt;-strptime(t3, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You got it right!</p>
<p>|==============================================================                  |  78%<br>
| Print the contents of t4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t4<br>
[1] "1986-10-17 08:24:00 IST"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|================================================================                |  81%<br>
| That's the format we've come to expect. Now, let's check its class().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class(t4)<br>
[1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Great job!</p>
<p>|===================================================================             |  83%<br>
| Finally, there are a number of operations that you can perform on dates and times,<br>
| including arithmetic operations (+ and -) and comparisons (&lt;, ==, etc.)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================================================           |  86%<br>
| The variable t1 contains the time at which you created it (recall you used Sys.time()).<br>
| Confirm that some time has passed since you created t1 by using the 'greater than'<br>
| operator to compare it to the current time: Sys.time() &gt; t1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sys.time()&gt;t1<br>
[1] TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|=======================================================================         |  89%<br>
| So we know that some time has passed, but how much? Try subtracting t1 from the current<br>
| time using Sys.time() - t1. Don't forget the parentheses at the end of Sys.time(),<br>
| since it is a function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sys.time()-t1<br>
Time difference of 12.21747 mins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|=========================================================================       |  92%<br>
| The same line of thinking applies to addition and the other comparison operators. If<br>
| you want more control over the units when finding the above difference in times, you<br>
| can use difftime(), which allows you to specify a 'units' parameter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================================    |  94%<br>
| Use difftime(Sys.time(), t1, units = 'days') to find the amount of time in DAYS that<br>
| has passed since you created t1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>difftime(Sys.time(), t1, units = 'days')<br>
Time difference of 0.01950932 days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>|==============================================================================  |  97%<br>
| In this lesson, you learned how to work with dates and times in R. While it is<br>

<p>| Nice work!</p>

| Let's simulate rolling four six-sided dice: sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE).</p>

| Now repeat the command to see how your result differs. (The probability of rolling the<br>
| exact same result is (1/6)^4 = 0.00077, which is pretty small!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sample(1:6,4,replace=TRUE)<br>

| sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE) instructs R to randomly select four numbers between 1<br>
| and 6, WITH replacement. Sampling with replacement simply means that each number is<br>
| "replaced" after it is selected, so that the same number can show up more than once.<br>
| This is what we want here, since what you roll on one die shouldn't affect what you<br>
| roll on any of the others.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============                                                                 |  18%<br>

| LETTERS is a predefined variable in R containing a vector of all 26 letters of the<br>
| English alphabet. Take a look at it now.</p>
<blockquote>

| The sample() function can also be used to permute, or rearrange, the elements of a<br>
| vector. For example, try sample(LETTERS) to permute all 26 letters of the English<br>
| alphabet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sample(LETTERS)<br>

| This is identical to taking a sample of size 26 from LETTERS, without replacement. When<br>
| the 'size' argument to sample() is not specified, R takes a sample equal in size to the<br>
| vector from which you are sampling.</p>

| Now, suppose we want to simulate 100 flips of an unfair two-sided coin. This particular<br>

| A binomial random variable represents the number of 'successes' (heads) in a given<br>
| number of independent 'trials' (coin flips). Therefore, we can generate a single random<br>
| variable that represents the number of heads in 100 flips of our unfair coin using<br>
| rbinom(1, size = 100, prob = 0.7). Note that you only specify the probability of<br>
