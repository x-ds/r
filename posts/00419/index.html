| In this lesson, we'll discuss some basic principles of presenting data effectively. These<br>
| will illustrate some fundamental concepts of displaying results in order to make them more<br>
| meaningful and convincing. These principles are cribbed from Edward Tufte's great 2006<br>
| book, Beautiful Evidence. You can read more about them at the www.edwardtufte.com website.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====                                                                              |   6%<br>
| As a warm-up, which of the following would NOT be a good use of analytic graphing?</p>
<p>1: To show causality, mechanism, explanation<br>
2: To show multivariate data<br>
3: To decide which horse to bet on at the track<br>
4: To show comparisons</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=======                                                                            |   8%<br>
| You're ready to start. Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of<br>
| analytic graphs is to show some comparison. You'll hear more about this when you study<br>
| statistical inference (another great course BTW), but evidence for a hypothesis is always<br>
| relative to another competing or alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========                                                                          |  11%<br>
| When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to<br>
| What?" This is why in commercials you often hear the phrase "other leading brands". An<br>
| implicit comparison, right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                       |  14%<br>
| Consider this boxplot which shows the relationship between the use of an air cleaner and<br>
| the number of symptom-free days of asthmatic children. (The top and bottom lines of the<br>
| box indicate the 25% and 75% quartiles of the data, and the horizontal line in the box<br>
| shows the 50%.) Since the box is above 0, the number of symptom-free days for children<br>
| with asthma is bigger using the air cleaner. This is good, right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040230.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============                                                                     |  17%<br>
| How many days of improvement does the median correspond to?</p>
<p>1: 4<br>
2: -2<br>
3: 1<br>
4: 12</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|================                                                                   |  19%<br>
| While it's somewhat informative, it's also somewhat cryptic, since the y-axis is claiming<br>
| to show a change in number of symptom-free days. Wouldn't it be better to show a<br>
| comparison?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==================                                                                 |  22%<br>
| Like this? Here's a graphic which shows two boxplots, the one on the left showing the<br>
| results for a control group that doesn't use an air cleaner alongside the previously shown<br>
| boxplot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================                                                              |  25%<br>
| By showing the two boxplots side by side, you can clearly see that using the air cleaner<br>
| increases the number of symptom-free days for most asthmatic children. The plot on the<br>
| right (using the air cleaner) is generally higher than the one on the left (the control<br>
| group).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040240.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|=======================                                                            |  28%<br>
| What does this graph NOT show you?</p>
<p>1: Half the chidren in the control group had no improvement<br>
2: Children in the control group had at most 3 symptom-free days<br>
3: 75% of the children using the air cleaner had at most 3 symptom-free days<br>
4: Using the air cleaner makes asthmatic children sicker</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|=========================                                                          |  31%<br>
| So the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality<br>
| or a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or systematic<br>
| structure shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're trying to<br>
| answer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================                                                       |  33%<br>
| Consider this plot which shows the dual boxplot we just showed, but next to it we have a<br>
| corresponding plot of changes in measures of particulate matter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040250.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============================                                                     |  36%<br>
| This picture tries to explain how the air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free<br>
| days for asthmatic children. What mechanism does the graph imply?</p>
<p>1: That the air cleaner increases pollution<br>
2: That the air cleaner reduces pollution<br>
3: That the children in the control group are healthier<br>
4: That the air in the control group is cleaner than the air in the other group</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|================================                                                   |  39%<br>
| By showing the two sets of boxplots side by side you're explaining your theory of why the<br>
| air cleaner increases the number of symptom-free days. Onward!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================                                                |  42%<br>
| So the first principle was to show some comparison, the second was to show a mechanism, so<br>
| what will the third principle say to show?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================                                              |  44%<br>
| Multivariate data!</p>

<p>|=======================================                                            |  47%<br>
| What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this term<br>
| means more than 2 variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school algebra.<br>
| Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts and equations<br>
| of lines? They're valuable, but usually questions are more complicated and require more<br>
| variables.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================================                                         |  50%<br>
| Sometimes, if you restrict yourself to two variables you'll be misled and draw an<br>
| incorrect conclusion.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================                                       |  53%<br>
| Consider this plot which shows the relationship between air pollution (x-axis) and<br>
| mortality rates among the elderly (y-axis). The blue regression line shows a surprising<br>
| result. (You'll learn about regression lines when you take the fabulous Regression Models<br>
| course.)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040260.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|==============================================                                     |  56%<br>
| What does the blue regression line indicate?</p>
<p>1: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more<br>
2: As pollution increases fewer people die<br>
3: As pollution increases the number of deaths doesn't change<br>
4: As pollution increases more people die</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| Excellent job!</p>
<p>|================================================                                   |  58%<br>
| Fewer deaths with more pollution? That's a surprise! Something's gotta be wrong, right? In<br>
| fact, this is an example of Simpson's paradox, or the Yule–Simpson effect. Wikipedia<br>
| (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox</a>) tells us that this "is a paradox in<br>
| probability and statistics, in which a trend that appears in different groups of data<br>
| disappears when these groups are combined."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================                                |  61%<br>
| Suppose we divided this mortality/pollution data into the four seasons. Would we see<br>
| different trends?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================================                              |  64%<br>
| Yes, we do! Plotting the same data for the 4 seasons individually we see a different<br>
| result.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040270.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>|=======================================================                            |  67%<br>
| What does the new plot indicate?</p>
<p>1: Pollution doesn't really increase, it just gets reported more<br>
2: As pollution increases the seasons change<br>
3: As pollution increases more people die in all seasons<br>
4: As pollution increases fewer people die in all seasons</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|==========================================================                         |  69%<br>
| The fourth principle of analytic graphing involves integrating evidence. This means not<br>
| limiting yourself to one form of expression. You can use words, numbers, images as well as<br>
| diagrams. Graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation. Remember, "Don't<br>
| let the tool drive the analysis!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================                       |  72%<br>
| To show you what we mean, here's an example of a figure taken from a paper published in<br>
| the Journal of the AMA. It shows the relationship between pollution and hospitalization of<br>
| people with heart disease. As you can see, it's a lot different from our previous plots.<br>
| The solid circles in the center portion indicate point estimates of percentage changes in<br>
| hospitalization rates for different levels of pollution. The lines through the circles<br>
| indicate confidence intervals associated with these estimates. (You'll learn more about<br>
| confidence intervals in another great course, the one on statistical inference.)</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040280.png" alt="graph" title="graph"><br>
...</p>
<p>|==============================================================                     |  75%<br>
| Note that on the right side of the figure is another column of numbers, one for each of<br>
| the point estimates given. This column shows posterior probabilities that relative risk is<br>
| greater than 0. This, in effect, is a measure of the strength of the evidence showing the<br>
| correlation between pollution and hospitalization.  The point here is that all of this<br>
| information is located in one picture so that the reader can see the strength of not only<br>
| the correlations but the evidence as well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================================================================                  |  78%<br>
| The fifth principle of graphing involves describing and documenting the evidence with<br>
| sources and appropriate labels and scales. Credibility is important so the data graphics<br>
| should tell a complete story. Also, using R, you want to preserve any code you use to<br>
| generate your data and graphics so that the research can be replicated if necessary. This<br>
| allows for easy verification or finding bugs in your analysis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================================                |  81%<br>
| The sixth and final principle of analytic graphing is maybe the most important. Content is<br>
| king! If you don't have something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you.<br>
| Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and<br>
| integrity of their content.</p>
