<p>|=                                                                            |   1%<br>
| This lesson is about using colors in R. It really supplements the lessons on<br>
| plotting with the base and lattice packages which contain functions that are able to<br>
| take the argument col. We'll discuss ways to set this argument more colorfully.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==                                                                           |   3%<br>
| Of course, color choice is secondary to your data and how you analyze it, but<br>
| effectively using colors can enhance your plots and presentations, emphasizing the<br>
| important points you're trying to convey.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===                                                                          |   4%<br>
| The motivation for this lesson is that the default color schemes for most plots in R<br>
| are not optimal. Fortunately there have been recent developments to improve the<br>
| handling and specification of colors in plots and graphs. We'll cover some functions<br>
| in R as well as in external packages that are very handy. If you know how to use<br>
| some of these then you'll have more options when you create your displays.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====                                                                         |   6%<br>
| We'll begin with a motivating example - a typical R plot using 3 default colors.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040830.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======                                                                       |   7%<br>
| According to the plot, what is color 2?</p>
<p>1: Blue<br>
2: Empty black circles<br>
3: Red<br>
4: Green</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| Nice work!</p>
<p>|=======                                                                      |   9%<br>
| So these are the first 3 default values. If you were plotting and just specified<br>
| col=c(1:3) as one of your arguments, these are colors you'd get. Maybe you like<br>
| them, but they might not be the best choice for your application.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========                                                                     |  10%<br>
| To show you some options, here's a display of two color palettes that come with the<br>
| grDevices package available to you. The left shows you some colors from the function<br>
| heat.colors. Here low values are represented in red and as the values increase the<br>
| colors move through yellow towards white. This is consistent with the physical<br>
| properties of fire. The right display is from the function topo.colors which uses<br>
| topographical colors ranging from blue (low values) towards brown (higher values).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040840.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========                                                                    |  12%<br>
| So we'll first discuss some functions that the grDevices package offers. The<br>
| function colors() lists the names of 657 predefined colors you can use in any<br>
| plotting function.  These names are returned as strings. Run the R command sample<br>
| with colors() as its first argument and 10 as its second to give you an idea of the<br>
| choices you have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sample(colors(),10)<br>
 [1] "gray1"         "darkorchid2"   "blue3"         "darkorchid3"   "gray10"<br>
 [6] "firebrick1"    "magenta3"      "gray75"        "lemonchiffon4" "rosybrown3"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Great job!</p>
<p>|==========                                                                   |  13%<br>
| We see a lot of variety in the colors, some of which are names followed by numbers<br>
| indicating that there are multiple forms of that particular color.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========                                                                  |  14%<br>
| So you're free to use any of these 600+ colors listed by the colors function.<br>
| However, two additional functions from grDevices, colorRamp and colorRampPalette,<br>
| give you more options. Both of these take color names as arguments and use them as<br>
| "palettes", that is, these argument colors are blended in different proportions to<br>
| form new colors.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                 |  16%<br>
| The first, colorRamp, takes a palette of colors (the arguments) and returns a<br>
| function that takes values between 0 and 1 as arguments. The 0 and 1 correspond to<br>
| the extremes of the color palette. Arguments between 0 and 1 return blends of these<br>
| extremes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============                                                                |  17%<br>
| Let's see what this means. Assign to the variable pal the output of a call to<br>
| colorRamp with the single argument, c("red","blue").</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pal&lt;-colorRamp(c("red","blue"))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|===============                                                              |  19%<br>
| We don't see any output, but R has created the function pal which we can call with a<br>
| single argument between 0 and 1. Call pal now with the argument 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pal(0)<br>
     [,1] [,2] [,3]<br>
[1,]  255    0    0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are quite good my friend!</p>
<p>|================                                                             |  20%<br>
| We see a 1 by 3 array with 255 as the first entry and 0 in the other 2. This 3 long<br>
| vector corresponds to red, green, blue (RGB) color encoding commonly used in<br>
| televisions and monitors. In R, 24 bits are used to represent colors. Think of these<br>
| 24 bits as 3 sets of 8 bits, each of which represents an intensity for one of the<br>
| colors red, green, and blue.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================                                                            |  22%<br>
| The 255 returned from the pal(0) call corresponds to the largest possible number<br>
| represented with 8 bits, so the vector (255,0,0) contains only red (no green or<br>
| blue), and moreover, it's the highest possible value of red.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==================                                                           |  23%<br>
| Given that you created pal with the palette containing "red" and "blue", what color<br>
| do you think will be represented by the vector that pal(1) returns? Recall that pal<br>
| will only take arguments between 0 and 1, so 1 is the largest argument you can pass<br>
| it.</p>
<p>1: blue<br>
2: red<br>
3: green<br>
4: yellow</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|===================                                                          |  25%<br>
| Check your answer now by calling pal with the argument 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pal(1)<br>
     [,1] [,2] [,3]<br>
[1,]    0    0  255</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|====================                                                         |  26%<br>
| You see the vector (0,0,255) which represents the highest intensity of blue. What<br>
| vector do you think the call pal(.5) will return?</p>
<p>1: (0,255,0)<br>
2: (255,255,255)<br>
3: (127.5,0,127.5)<br>
4: (255,0,255)</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|=====================                                                        |  28%<br>
| The function pal can take more than one argument. It returns one 3-long (or 4-long,<br>
| but more about this later) vector for each argument. To see this in action, call pal<br>
| with the argument seq(0,1,len=6).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pal(seq(0,1,len=6))</p>

<pre><code>     [,1] [,2] [,3]  
[1,]  255    0    0  
[2,]  204    0   51  
[3,]  153    0  102  
[4,]  102    0  153  
[5,]   51    0  204  
[6,]    0    0  255</code></pre>
<p>| Nice work!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>|======================                                                       |  29%<br>
| Six vectors (each of length 3) are returned. The i-th vector is identical to output<br>
| that would be returned by the call pal(i/5) for i=0,...5. We see that the i-th row<br>
| (for i=1,...6) differs from the (i-1)-st row in the following way. Its red entry is<br>
| 51 = 255/5 points lower and its blue entry is 51 points higher.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================                                                      |  30%<br>
| So pal creates colors using the palette we specified when we called colorRamp. In<br>
| this example none of pal's outputs will ever contain green since it wasn't in our<br>
| initial palette.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========================                                                    |  32%<br>
| We'll turn now to colorRampPalette, a function similar to colorRamp. It also takes a<br>
| palette of colors and returns a function. This function, however, takes integer<br>
| arguments (instead of numbers between 0 and 1) and returns a vector of colors each<br>
| of which is a blend of colors of the original palette.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================                                                   |  33%<br>
| The argument you pass to the returned function specifies the number of colors you<br>
| want returned. Each element of the returned vector is a 24 bit number, represented<br>
| as 6 hexadecimal characters, which range from 0 to F. This set of 6 hex characters<br>
| represents the intensities of red, green, and blue, 2 characters for each color.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================                                                  |  35%<br>
| To see this better, assign to the variable p1 the output of a call to<br>
| colorRampPalette with the single argument, c("red","blue"). We'll compare it to our<br>
| experiments using colorRamp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p1&lt;-colorRampPalette(c("red","blue"))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|============================                                                 |  36%<br>
| Now call p1 with the argument 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p1(2)<br>
[1] "#FF0000" "#0000FF"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|=============================                                                |  38%<br>
| We see a 2-long vector is returned. The first entry FF0000 represents red. The FF is<br>
| hexadecimal for 255, the same value returned by our call pal(0). The second entry<br>
| 0000FF represents blue, also with intensity 255.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============================                                               |  39%<br>
| Now call p1 with the argument 6. Let's see if we get the same result as we did when<br>
| we called pal with the argument seq(0,1,len=6).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p1(6)<br>
[1] "#FF0000" "#CC0033" "#990066" "#650099" "#3200CC" "#0000FF"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|===============================                                              |  41%<br>
| Now we get the 6-long vector (FF0000, CC0033, 990066, 650099, 3200CC, 0000FF). We<br>
| see the two ends (FF0000 and 0000FF) are consistent with the colors red and blue.<br>
| How about CC0033? Type 0xcc or 0xCC at the command line to see the decimal<br>
| equivalent of this hex number. You must include the 0 before the x to specify that<br>
| you're entering a hexadecimal number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0xCC<br>
[1] 204</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|================================                                             |  42%<br>
| So 0xCC equals 204 and we can easily convert hex 33 to decimal, as in<br>
| 0x33=3*16+3=51. These were exactly the numbers we got in the second row returned<br>
| from our call to pal(seq(0,1,len=6)). We see that 4 of the 6 numbers agree with our<br>
| earlier call to pal. Two of the 6 differ slightly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================================                                            |  43%<br>
| We can also form palettes using colors other than red, green and blue. Form a<br>
| palette, p2, by calling colorRampPalette with the colors "red" and "yellow".<br>
| Remember to concatenate them into a single argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p2&lt;-colorRampPalette(c("red","yellow"))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|===================================                                          |  45%<br>
| Now call p2 with the argument 2. This will show us the two extremes of the blends of<br>
| colors we'll get.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p2(2)<br>
[1] "#FF0000" "#FFFF00"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|====================================                                         |  46%<br>
| Not surprisingly the first color we see is FF0000, which we know represents red. The<br>
| second color returned, FFFF00, must represent yellow, a combination of full<br>
| intensity red and full intensity green. This makes sense, since yellow falls between<br>
| red and green on the color wheel as we see here. (We borrowed this image from<br>
| lucaskrech.com.)</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040850.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================                                        |  48%<br>
| Let's now call p2 with the argument 10. This will show us how the two extremes, red<br>
| and yellow, are blended together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p2(10)<br>
 [1] "#FF0000" "#FF1C00" "#FF3800" "#FF5500" "#FF7100" "#FF8D00" "#FFAA00" "#FFC600"<br>
 [9] "#FFE200" "#FFFF00"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|======================================                                       |  49%<br>
| So we see the 10-long vector. For each element, the red component is fixed at FF,<br>
| and the green component grows from 00 (at the first element) to FF (at the last).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================                                      |  51%<br>
| This is all fine and dandy but you're probably wondering when you can see how all<br>
| these colors show up in a display. We copied some code from the R documentation<br>
| pages (color.scale if you're interested) and created a function for you, showMe.<br>
| This takes as an argument, a color vector, which as you know, is precisely what<br>
| calls to p1 and p2 return to you. Call showMe now with p1(20).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showMe(p1(20))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040860.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| That's the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>|========================================                                     |  52%<br>
| We see the interpolated palette here. Low values in the lower left corner are red<br>
| and as you move to the upper right, the colors move toward blue. Now call showMe<br>
| with p2(20) as its argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showMe(p2(20))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040870.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|=========================================                                    |  54%<br>
| Here we see a similar display, the colors moving from red to yellow, the base colors<br>
| of our p2 palette. For fun, see what p2(2) looks like using showMe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showMe(p2(2))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040880.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|==========================================                                   |  55%<br>
| A much more basic pattern, simple but elegant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================                                 |  57%<br>
| We mentioned before that colorRamp (and colorRampPalette) could return a 3 or 4 long<br>
| vector of colors. We saw 3-long vectors returned indicating red, green, and blue<br>
| intensities. What would the 4th entry be?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================================                                |  58%<br>
| We'll answer this indirectly. First, look at the function p1 that colorRampPalette<br>
| returned to you. Just type p1 at the command prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p1<br>
function (n)<br>
{<br>
    x &lt;- ramp(seq.int(0, 1, length.out = n))<br>
    if (ncol(x) == 4L)<br>
        rgb(x[, 1L], x[, 2L], x[, 3L], x[, 4L], maxColorValue = 255)<br>
    else rgb(x[, 1L], x[, 2L], x[, 3L], maxColorValue = 255)<br>
}</p>
<p>&lt;bytecode: 0x00000174e0c71940&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;environment: 0x00000174dbdd5a00&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|==============================================                               |  59%<br>
| We see that p1 is a short function with one argument, n. The argument n is used as<br>
| the length in a call to the function seq.int, itself an argument to the function<br>
| ramp. We can infer that ramp is just going to divide the interval from 0 to 1 into n<br>
| pieces.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============================================                              |  61%<br>
| The heart of p1 is really the call to the function rgb with either 4 or 5 arguments.<br>
| Use the ?fun construct to look at the R documentation for rgb now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?rgb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|================================================                             |  62%<br>
| We see that rgb is a color specification function that can be used to produce any<br>
| color with red, green, blue proportions. We see the maxColorValue is 1 by default,<br>
| so if we called rgb with values for red, green and blue, we would specify numbers at<br>
| most 1 (assuming we didn't change the default for maxColorValue). According to the<br>
| documentation, what is the maximum number of arguments rgb can have?</p>
<p>1: 6<br>
2: 4<br>
3: 5<br>
4: 3</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|=================================================                            |  64%<br>
| So the fourth argument is alpha which can be a logical, i.e., either TRUE or FALSE,<br>
| or a numerical value. Create the function p3 now by calling colorRampPalette with<br>
| the colors blue and green (remember to concatenate them into a single argument) and<br>
| setting the alpha argument to .5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p3&lt;-colorRampPalette(c("blue","green"),alpha=0.5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|==================================================                           |  65%<br>
| Now call p3 with the argument 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>p3(5)<br>
[1] "#0000FFFF" "#003FBFFF" "#007F7FFF" "#00BF3FFF" "#00FF00FF"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Perseverance, that's the answer.</p>
<p>|===================================================                          |  67%<br>
| We see that in the 5-long vector that the call returned, each element has 32 bits, 4<br>
| groups of 8 bits each. The last 8 bits represent the value of alpha. Since it was<br>
| NOT ZERO in the call to colorRampPalette, it gets the maximum FF value. (The same<br>
| result would happen if alpha had been set to TRUE.) When it was 0 or FALSE (as in<br>
| previous calls to colorRampPalette) it was given the value 00 and wasn't shown. The<br>
| leftmost 24 bits of each element are the same RGB encoding we previously saw.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================================================                         |  68%<br>
| So what is alpha? Alpha represents an opacity level, that is, how transparent should<br>
| the colors be. We can add color transparency with the alpha parameter to calls to<br>
| rgb. We haven't seen any examples of this yet, but we will now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================================================                       |  70%<br>
| We generated 1000 random normal pairs for you in the variables x and y. We'll plot<br>
| them in a scatterplot by calling plot with 4 arguments. The variables x and y are<br>
| the first 2. The third is the print character argument pch. Set this equal to 19<br>
| (filled circles). The final argument is col which should be set equal to a call to<br>
| rgb. Give rgb 3 arguments, 0, .5, and .5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plot(x,y,pch=19,col=rgb(0,0.5,0.5))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040890.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|=======================================================                      |  71%<br>
| Well this picture is okay for a scatterplot, a nice mix of blue and green, but it<br>
| really doesn't tell us too much information in the center portion, since the points<br>
| are so thick there. We see there are a lot of points, but is one area more filled<br>
| than another? We can't really discriminate between different point densities. This<br>
| is where the alpha argument can help us. Recall your plot command (use the up arrow)<br>
| and add a 4th argument, .3, to the call to rgb. This will be our value for alpha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plot(x,y,pch=19,col=rgb(0,0.5,0.5,0.3))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040900.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| You are amazing!</p>
<p>|========================================================                     |  72%<br>
| Clearly this is better. It shows us where, specifically, the densest areas of the<br>
| scatterplot really are.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========================================================                    |  74%<br>
| Our last topic for this lesson is the RColorBrewer Package, available on CRAN, that<br>
| contains interesting and useful color palettes, of which there are 3 types,<br>
| sequential, divergent, and qualitative. Which one you would choose to use depends on<br>
| your data.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========================================================                   |  75%<br>
| Here's a picture of the palettes available from this package. The top section shows<br>
| the sequential palettes in which the colors are ordered from light to dark. The<br>
| divergent palettes are at the bottom. Here the neutral color (white) is in the<br>
| center, and as you move from the middle to the two ends of each palette, the colors<br>
| increase in intensity. The middle display shows the qualitative palettes which look<br>
| like collections of random colors. These might be used to distinguish factors in<br>
| your data.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040910.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================================================                  |  77%<br>
| These colorBrewer palettes can be used in conjunction with the colorRamp() and<br>
| colorRampPalette() functions. You would use colors from a colorBrewer palette as<br>
| your base palette,i.e., as arguments to colorRamp or colorRampPalette which would<br>
| interpolate them to create new colors.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================                 |  78%<br>
| As an example of this, create a new object, cols by calling the function brewer.pal<br>
| with 2 arguments, 3 and "BuGn". The string "BuGn" is the second last palette in the<br>
| sequential display. The 3 tells the function how many different colors we want.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cols&lt;-brewer.pal(3,"BuGn")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>|=============================================================                |  80%<br>
| Use showMe to look at cols now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showMe(cols)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040920.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|==============================================================               |  81%<br>
| We see 3 colors, mixes of blue and green. Now create the variable pal by calling<br>
| colorRampPalette with cols as its argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pal&lt;-colorRampPalette(cols)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|================================================================             |  83%<br>
| The call showMe(pal(3)) would be identical to the showMe(cols) call. So use showMe<br>
| to look at pal(20).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>showMe(pal(20))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040930.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=================================================================            |  84%<br>
| Now we can use the colors in pal(20) to display topographic information on<br>
| Auckland's Maunga Whau Volcano. R provides this information in a matrix called<br>
| volcano which is included in the package datasets.  Call the R function image with<br>
| volcano as its first argument and col set equal to pal(20) as its second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>image(volcano,col=pal(20))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040940.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| Great job!</p>
<p>|==================================================================           |  86%<br>
| We see that the colors here of the sequential palette clue us in on the topography.<br>
| The darker colors are more concentrated than the lighter ones. Just for fun, recall<br>
| your last command calling image and instead of pal(20), use p1(20) as the second<br>
| argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>image(volcano,col=p1(20))</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040950.png" alt="image" title="image"></p>
<p>| Your dedication is inspiring!</p>
<p>|===================================================================          |  87%<br>
