<p>| Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the R language. They are small<br>
| pieces of reusable code that can be treated like any other R object.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==                                                                              |   2%<br>
| If you've worked through any other part of this course, you've probably used some<br>
| functions already. Functions are usually characterized by the name of the function<br>
| followed by parentheses.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===                                                                             |   4%<br>
| Let's try using a few basic functions just for fun. The Sys.Date() function returns a<br>
| string representing today's date. Type Sys.Date() below and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sys.Date()<br>
[1] "2020-04-15"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=====                                                                           |   6%<br>
| Most functions in R return a value. Functions like Sys.Date() return a value based on<br>
| your computer's environment, while other functions manipulate input data in order to<br>
| compute a return value.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======                                                                         |   8%<br>
| The mean() function takes a vector of numbers as input, and returns the average of all<br>
| of the numbers in the input vector. Inputs to functions are often called arguments.<br>
| Providing arguments to a function is also sometimes called passing arguments to that<br>
| function. Arguments you want to pass to a function go inside the function's<br>
| parentheses. Try passing the argument c(2, 4, 5) to the mean() function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mean(c(2,4,5))<br>
[1] 3.666667</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|========                                                                        |  10%<br>
| Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates on. For<br>
| example, the mean() function takes a vector as an argument, like in the case of<br>
| mean(c(2,6,8)). The mean() function then adds up all of the numbers in the vector and<br>
| divides that sum by the length of the vector.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========                                                                      |  12%<br>
| In the following question you will be asked to modify a script that will appear as soon<br>
| as you move on from this question. When you have finished modifying the script, save<br>
| your changes to the script and type submit() and the script will be evaluated. There<br>
| will be some comments in the script that opens up, so be sure to read them!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========                                                                     |  14%<br>
| The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the return value of<br>
| that function. We want this function to take one argument, x, and return x without<br>
| modifying it. Delete the pound sign so that x is returned without any modification.<br>
| Make sure to save your script before you type submit().</p>

<pre><code># You're about to write your first function! Just like you would assign a value 
# to a variable with the assignment operator, you assign functions in the following
# way:
#
# function_name &lt;- function(arg1, arg2){
#   # Manipulate arguments in some way
#   # Return a value
# }
#
# The "variable name" you assign will become the name of your function. arg1 and
# arg2 represent the arguments of your function. You can manipulate the arguments
# you specify within the function. After sourcing the function, you can use the 
# function by typing:
# 
# function_name(value1, value2)
#
# Below we will create a function called boring_function. This function takes
# the argument `x` as input, and returns the value of x without modifying it.
# Delete the pound sign in front of the x to make the function work! Be sure to 
# save this script and type submit() in the console after you make your changes.

| Now that you've created your first function let's test it! Type: boring_function('My<br>
| first function!'). If your function works, it should just return the string: 'My first<br>

<blockquote>
<p>boring_function('My first function!')<br>

| Congratulations on writing your first function. By writing functions, you can gain<br>
| serious insight into how R works. As John Chambers, the creator of R once said:<br>
|<br>
| To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful: 1. Everything that exists is<br>
| an object. 2. Everything that happens is a function call.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|================                                                                |  20%<br>
| If you want to see the source code for any function, just type the function name<br>
| without any arguments or parentheses. Let's try this out with the function you just<br>
| created. Type: boring_function to view its source code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boring_function<br>
function(x) {<br>
  x<br>

<p>&lt;bytecode: 0x00000000190a1b98&gt;</p>

| Time to make a more useful function! We're going to replicate the functionality of the<br>
| mean() function by creating a function called: my_mean(). Remember that to calculate<br>
| the average of all of the numbers in a vector you find the sum of all the numbers in<br>
| the vector, and then divide that sum by the number of numbers in the vector.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================                                                            |  24%<br>
| Make sure to save your script before you type submit().</p>

<pre><code># You're free to implement the function my_mean however you want, as long as it
# returns the average of all of the numbers in `my_vector`.
#
# Hint #1: sum() returns the sum of a vector.
#   Ex: sum(c(1, 2, 3)) evaluates to 6
#
# Hint #2: length() returns the size of a vector.
#   Ex: length(c(1, 2, 3)) evaluates to 3
#
# Hint #3: The mean of all the numbers in a vector is equal to the sum of all of
#          the numbers in the vector divided by the size of the vector.
#
# Note for those of you feeling super clever: Please do not use the mean()
# function while writing this function. We're trying to teach you something 
# here!
#
# Be sure to save this script and type submit() in the console after you make 
# your changes.

my_mean &lt;- function(my_vector) {
  # Write your code here!

| Now test out your my_mean() function by finding the mean of the vector c(4, 5, 10).</p>

| Next, let's try writing a function with default arguments. You can set default values<br>
| for a function's arguments, and this can be useful if you think someone who uses your<br>
| function will set a certain argument to the same value most of the time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========================                                                        |  31%<br>
| Make sure to save your script before you type submit().</p>

<pre><code># Let me show you an example of a function I'm going to make up called
# increment(). Most of the time I want to use this function to increase the
# value of a number by one. This function will take two arguments: "number" and
# "by" where "number" is the digit I want to increment and "by" is the amount I
# want to increment "number" by. I've written the function below. 
#
# increment &lt;- function(number, by = 1){
#     number + by
# }
#
# If you take a look in between the parentheses you can see that I've set
# "by" equal to 1. This means that the "by" argument will have the default
# value of 1.
#
# I can now use the increment function without providing a value for "by": 
# increment(5) will evaluate to 6. 
#
# However if I want to provide a value for the "by" argument I still can! The
# expression: increment(5, 2) will evaluate to 7. 
# 
# You're going to write a function called "remainder." remainder() will take
# two arguments: "num" and "divisor" where "num" is divided by "divisor" and
# the remainder is returned. Imagine that you usually want to know the remainder
# when you divide by 2, so set the default value of "divisor" to 2. Please be
# sure that "num" is the first argument and "divisor" is the second argument.
#
# Hint #1: You can use the modulus operator %% to find the remainder.
#   Ex: 7 %% 4 evaluates to 3. 
#
# Remember to set appropriate default values! Be sure to save this 
# script and type submit() in the console after you write the function.

remainder &lt;- function(num, divisor=2) {
  # Write your code here!
  # Remember: the last expression evaluated will be returned! 
  num%%divisor

| Let's do some testing of the remainder function. Run remainder(5) and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remainder(5)<br>
[1] 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|============================                                                    |  35%<br>
| Let's take a moment to examine what just happened. You provided one argument to the<br>
| function, and R matched that argument to 'num' since 'num' is the first argument. The<br>
| default value for 'divisor' is 2, so the function used the default value you provided.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=============================                                                   |  37%<br>
| Now let's test the remainder function by providing two arguments. Type: remainder(11,<br>
| 5) and let's see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remainder(11,5)<br>
[1] 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|===============================                                                 |  39%<br>
| Once again, the arguments have been matched appropriately.</p>

<p>|=================================                                               |  41%<br>
| You can also explicitly specify arguments in a function. When you explicitly designate<br>
| argument values by name, the ordering of the arguments becomes unimportant. You can try<br>
| this out by typing: remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)<br>
[1] 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|==================================                                              |  43%<br>
| As you can see, there is a significant difference between remainder(11, 5) and<br>
| remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================================                                            |  45%<br>
| R can also partially match arguments. Try typing remainder(4, div = 2) to see this<br>
| feature in action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remainder(4, div = 2)<br>
[1] 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|======================================                                          |  47%<br>
| A word of warning: in general you want to make your code as easy to understand as<br>
| possible. Switching around the orders of arguments by specifying their names or only<br>
| using partial argument names can be confusing, so use these features with caution!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================================                                         |  49%<br>
| With all of this talk about arguments, you may be wondering if there is a way you can<br>
| see a function's arguments (besides looking at the documentation). Thankfully, you can<br>
| use the args() function! Type: args(remainder) to examine the arguments for the<br>
| remainder function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>args(remainder)<br>
function (num, divisor = 2)<br>
NULL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are quite good my friend!</p>

| You may not realize it but I just tricked you into doing something pretty interesting!<br>
| args() is a function, remainder() is a function, yet remainder was an argument for<br>
| args(). Yes it's true: you can pass functions as arguments! This is a very powerful<br>
| concept. Let's write a script to see how it works.</p>

# "func" argument and some data (like a vector) is passed into the dat argument
# the evaluate() function will return the result of dat being passed as an
# argument to func.
#
# Hints: This exercise is a little tricky so I'll provide a few example of how
# evaluate() should act:
#    1. evaluate(sum, c(2, 4, 6)) should evaluate to 12
#    2. evaluate(median, c(7, 40, 9)) should evaluate to 9
#    3. evaluate(floor, 11.1) should evaluate to 11

evaluate &lt;- function(func, dat){
  # Write your code here!
  # Remember: the last expression evaluated will be returned! 
  func(dat)

| You may be surprised to learn that you can pass a function as an argument without first<br>
| defining the passed function. Functions that are not named are appropriately known as<br>
| anonymous functions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=================================================                               |  61%<br>
| Let's use the evaluate function to explore how anonymous functions work. For the first<br>
| argument of the evaluate function we're going to write a tiny function that fits on one<br>
| line. In the second argument we'll pass some data to the tiny anonymous function in the<br>
| first argument.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|====================================================                            |  65%<br>
| The first argument is a tiny anonymous function that takes one argument <code>x</code> and returns<br>
| <code>x+1</code>. We passed the number 6 into this function so the entire expression evaluates to<br>

| As you can see the first argument of paste() is <code>...</code> which is referred to as an<br>
| ellipsis or simply dot-dot-dot. The ellipsis allows an indefinite number of arguments<br>
| to be passed into a function. In the case of paste() any number of strings can be<br>
| passed as arguments and paste() will return all of the strings combined into one<br>
| string.</p>

<pre><code># The ellipses can be used to pass on arguments to other functions that are
# used within the function you're writing. Usually a function that has the
# ellipses as an argument has the ellipses as the last argument. The usage of
# such a function would look like:
#
# ellipses_func(arg1, arg2 = TRUE, ...)
#
# In the above example arg1 has no default value, so a value must be provided
# for arg1. arg2 has a default value, and other arguments can come after arg2
# depending on how they're defined in the ellipses_func() documentation.
# Interestingly the usage for the paste function is as follows:
#
# paste (..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)
#
# Notice that the ellipses is the first argument, and all other arguments after
# the ellipses have default values. This is a strict rule in R programming: all
# arguments after an ellipses must have default values. Take a look at the
# simon_says function below:
#
# simon_says &lt;- function(...){
#   paste("Simon says:", ...)
# }
#
# The simon_says function works just like the paste function, except the
# begining of every string is prepended by the string "Simon says:"
#
# Telegrams used to be peppered with the words START and STOP in order to
# demarcate the beginning and end of sentences. Write a function below called 
# telegram that formats sentences for telegrams.
# For example the expression `telegram("Good", "morning")` should evaluate to:
# "START Good morning STOP"

telegram &lt;- function(...){
  paste("START",...,"STOP")

<pre><code># Let's explore how to "unpack" arguments from an ellipses when you use the

#   # First we must capture the ellipsis inside of a list

#
#   # We're now going to assume that there are two named arguments within args

| We're coming to the end of this lesson, but there's still one more idea you should be<br>
| made aware of.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========================================================================        |  90%<br>
| You're familiar with adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers in R. To do<br>
| this you use the +, -, *, and / symbols. These symbols are called binary operators<br>
| because they take two inputs, an input from the left and an input from the right.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=========================================================================       |  92%<br>
| In R you can define your own binary operators. In the next script I'll show you how.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================================================================     |  94%<br>
| Make sure to save your script before you type submit().</p>

<pre><code># The syntax for creating new binary operators in R is unlike anything else in
# R, but it allows you to define a new syntax for your function. I would only
# recommend making your own binary operator if you plan on using it often!
#
# User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:
#      %[whatever]% 
# where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.
# 
# Let's say I wanted to define a binary operator that multiplied two numbers and
# then added one to the product. An implementation of that operator is below:
#
# "%mult_add_one%" &lt;- function(left, right){ # Notice the quotation marks!
#   left * right + 1
# }
#
# I could then use this binary operator like `4 %mult_add_one% 5` which would
# evaluate to 21.
#
# Write your own binary operator below from absolute scratch! Your binary
# operator must be called %p% so that the expression:
#
#       "Good" %p% "job!"
#
# will evaluate to: "Good job!"

"%p%" &lt;- function(x,y){ # Remember to add arguments!
  paste(x,y)
