| In this lesson, we'll discuss why graphics are an important tool for data scientists and<br>
| the special role that exploratory graphs play in the field.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==                                                                                 |   3%<br>
| Which of the following would NOT be a good reason to use graphics in data science?</p>
<p>1: To understand data properties<br>
2: To find a color that best matches the shirt you're wearing<br>
3: To find patterns in data<br>
4: To suggest modeling strategies</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<p>| All that practice is paying off!</p>
<p>|===                                                                                |   4%<br>
| So graphics give us some visual form of data, and since our brains are very good at seeing<br>
| patterns, graphs give us a compact way to present data and find or display any pattern<br>
| that may be present.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====                                                                               |   5%<br>
| Which of the following cliches captures the essence of graphics?</p>
<p>1: To err is human, to forgive divine<br>
2: A rose by any other name smells as sweet<br>
3: A picture is worth a 1000 words<br>
4: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|======                                                                             |   7%<br>
| Exploratory graphs serve mostly the same functions as graphs. They help us find patterns<br>
| in data and understand its properties. They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug<br>
| analyses. We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======                                                                            |   8%<br>
| Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in an investigation, the "quick and<br>
| dirty" tool used to point the data scientist in a fruitful direction. A scientist might<br>
| need to make a lot of exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal understanding of<br>
| the problem being studied. Plot details such as axes, legends, color and size are cleaned<br>
| up later to convey more information in an aesthetically pleasing way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|========                                                                           |   9%<br>
| To demonstrate these ideas, we've copied some data for you from the U.S. Environmental<br>
| Protection Agency (EPA) which sets national ambient air quality standards for outdoor air<br>
| pollution. These Standards say that for fine particle pollution (PM2.5), the "annual mean,<br>
| averaged over 3 years" cannot exceed 12 micro grams per cubic meter. We stored the data<br>
| from the U.S. EPA web site in the data frame pollution. Use the R function head to see the<br>
| first few entries of pollution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>head(pollution)<br>
       pm25  fips region longitude latitude<br>
1  9.771185 01003   east -87.74826 30.59278<br>
2  9.993817 01027   east -85.84286 33.26581<br>
3 10.688618 01033   east -87.72596 34.73148<br>
4 11.337424 01049   east -85.79892 34.45913<br>
5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860<br>
6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|=========                                                                          |  11%<br>
| We see right away that there's at least one county exceeding the EPA's standard of 12<br>
| micrograms per cubic meter. What else do we see?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==========                                                                         |  12%<br>
| We see 5 columns of data. The pollution count is in the first column labeled pm25. We'll<br>
| work mostly with that. The other 4 columns are a fips code indicating the state (first 2<br>
| digits) and county (last 3 digits) with that count, the associated region (east or west),<br>
| and the longitude and latitude of the area. Now run the R command dim with pollution as an<br>
| argument to see how long the table is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dim(pollution)<br>
[1] 576   5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Great job!</p>
<p>|===========                                                                        |  13%<br>
| So there are 576 entries in pollution. We'd like to investigate the question "Are there<br>
| any counties in the U.S. that exceed that national standard (12 micro grams per cubic<br>
| meter) for fine particle pollution?" We'll look at several one dimensional summaries of<br>
| the data to investigate this question.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============                                                                       |  15%<br>
| The first technique uses the R command summary, a 5-number summary which returns 6<br>
| numbers. Run it now with the pm25 column of pollution as its argument. Recall that the<br>
| construct for this is pollution$pm25.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>summary(pollution$pm25)<br>
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.<br>
  3.383   8.549  10.047   9.836  11.356  18.441</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| You are doing so well!</p>
<p>|=============                                                                      |  16%<br>
| This shows us basic info about the pm25 data, namely its Minimum (0 percentile) and<br>
| Maximum (100 percentile) values, and three Quartiles of the data. These last indicate the<br>
| pollution measures at which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the counties fall below. In addition to<br>
| these 5 numbers we see the Mean or average measure of particulate pollution across the 576<br>
| counties.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============                                                                     |  17%<br>
| Half the measured counties have a pollution level less than or equal to what number of<br>
| micrograms per cubic meter?</p>
<p>1: 10.050<br>
2: 9.836<br>
3: 8.549<br>
4: 11.360</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| You're the best!</p>
<p>|===============                                                                    |  19%<br>
| To save you a lot of typing we've saved off pollution$pm25 for you in the variable ppm.<br>
| You can use ppm now in place of the longer expression. Try it now as the argument of the R<br>
| command quantile. See how the results look a lot like the results of the output of the<br>
| summary command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>quantile(ppm)<br>
       0%       25%       50%       75%      100%<br>
 3.382626  8.548799 10.046697 11.356012 18.440731</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| All that hard work is paying off!</p>
<p>|=================                                                                  |  20%<br>
| See how the results are similar to those returned by summary? Quantile gives the<br>
| quartiles, right? What is the one value missing from this quantile output that summary<br>
| gave you?</p>
<p>1: the maximum value<br>
2: the median<br>
3: the minimum value<br>
4: the mean</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|==================                                                                 |  21%<br>
| Now we'll plot a picture, specifically a boxplot. Run the R command boxplot with ppm as an<br>
| input. Also specify the color parameter col equal to "blue".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boxplot(ppm,col="blue")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040290.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|===================                                                                |  23%<br>
| The boxplot shows us the same quartile data that summary and quantile did. The lower and<br>
| upper edges of the blue box respectively show the values of the 25% and 75% quantiles.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================                                                               |  24%<br>
| What do you think the horizontal line inside the box represents?</p>
<p>1: the maximum value<br>
2: the mean<br>
3: the minimum value<br>
4: the median</p>
<p>Selection: 4</p>
<p>| Nice work!</p>
<p>|=====================                                                              |  25%<br>
| The "whiskers" of the box (the vertical lines extending above and below the box) relate to<br>
| the range parameter of boxplot, which we let default to the value 1.5 used by R. The<br>
| height of the box is the interquartile range, the difference between the 75th and 25th<br>
| quantiles. In this case that difference is 2.8. The whiskers are drawn to be a length of<br>
| range<em>2.8 or 1.5</em>2.8. This shows us roughly how many, if any, data points are outliers,<br>
| that is, beyond this range of values.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|======================                                                             |  27%<br>
| Note that boxplot is part of R's base plotting package. A nice feature that this package<br>
| provides is its ability to overlay features. That is, you can add to (annotate) an<br>
| existing plot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=======================                                                            |  28%<br>
| To see this, run the R command abline with the argument h equal to 12. Recall that 12 is<br>
| the EPA standard for air quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>abline(h=12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040300.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|========================                                                           |  29%<br>
| What do you think this command did?</p>
<p>1: drew a horizontal line at 12<br>
2: hid 12 random data points<br>
3: drew a vertical line at 12<br>
4: nothing</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<p>| Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>|=========================                                                          |  31%<br>
| So abline "adds one or more straight lines through the current plot." We see from the plot<br>
| that the bulk of the measured counties comply with the standard since they fall under the<br>
| line marking that standard.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===========================                                                        |  32%<br>
| Now use the R command hist (another function from the base package) with the argument ppm.<br>
| Specify the color parameter col equal to "green". This will plot a histogram of the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(ppm,col="green")</p>
</blockquote>

| Better, right? Thicker and more of a contrast in color. This shows that although the<br>

<p>|============================================                                       |  53%<br>
| Now recall that our pollution data had 5 columns of information. So far we've only looked<br>
| at the pm25 column. We can also look at other information. To remind yourself what's there<br>

| Longitude and latitude don't sound interesting, and each fips is unique since it<br>
| identifies states (first 2 digits) and counties (last 3 digits). Let's look at the region<br>

| So we've seen several examples of one-dimensional graphs that summarize data. Two<br>
| dimensional graphs include scatterplots, multiple graphs which we'll see more examples of,<br>
| and overlayed one-dimensional plots which the R packages such as lattice and ggplot2<br>
| provide.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===================================================                                |  61%<br>
| Some graphs have more than two-dimensions. These include overlayed or multiple<br>
| two-dimensional plots and spinning plots. Some three-dimensional plots are tricky to<br>
| understand so have limited applications. We'll see some examples now of more complicated<br>
| graphs, in particular, we'll show two graphs together.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|====================================================                               |  63%<br>
| First we'll show how R, in one line and using base plotting, can display multiple<br>
| boxplots. We simply specify that we want to see the pollution data as a function of<br>
| region. We know that our pollution data characterized each of the 576 entries as belonging<br>
| to one of two regions (east and west).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|=====================================================                              |  64%<br>
| We use the R formula y ~ x to show that y (in this case pm25) depends on x (region). Since<br>
| both come from the same data frame (pollution) we can specify a data argument set equal to<br>
| pollution. By doing this, we don't have to type pollution$pm25 (or ppm) and  
| pollution$region. We can just specify the formula pm25~region. Call boxplot now with this<br>
| formula as its argument, data equal to pollution, and col equal to "red".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boxplot(pm25~region,data=pollution,col="red")</p>

<p><img src="../../images/r0040380.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| Perseverance, that's the answer.</p>
<p>|======================================================                             |  65%<br>
| Two for the price of one! Similarly we can plot multiple histograms in one plot, though to<br>
| do this we have to use more than one R command. First we have to set up the plot window<br>
| with the R command par which specifies how we want to lay out the plots, say one above the<br>
| other. We also use par to specify margins, a 4-long vector which indicates the number of<br>
| lines for the bottom, left, top and right. Type the R command<br>
| par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1)) now. Don't expect to see any new result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(4,4,2,1))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| That's a job well done!</p>
<p>|=======================================================                            |  67%<br>
| So we set up the plot window for two rows and one column with the mfrow argument. The mar<br>
| argument set up the margins. Before we plot the histograms let's explore the R command<br>
| subset which, not surprisingly, "returns subsets of vectors, matrices or data frames which<br>
| meet conditions". We'll use subset to pull off the data we want to plot. Call subset now<br>
| with pollution as its first argument and a boolean expression testing region for equality<br>
| with the string "east". Put the result in the variable east.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>east&lt;-subset(pollution,region=="east")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>| Keep working like that and you'll get there!</p>
<p>|========================================================                           |  68%<br>
| Use head to look at the first few entries of east.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>head(east)<br>
       pm25  fips region longitude latitude<br>

5 12.119764 01055   east -86.03212 34.01860<br>
6 10.827805 01069   east -85.35039 31.18973</p>

<p>| Excellent work!</p>
<p>|==========================================================                         |  69%<br>
| So east holds more information than we need. We just want to plot a histogram with the<br>
| pm25 portion. Call hist now with the pm25 portion of east as its first argument and col<br>
| equal to "green" as its second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hist(east$pm25,col="green")</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../images/r0040390.png" alt="graph" title="graph"></p>
<p>| You got it!</p>
<p>|===========================================================                        |  71%<br>
| See? The command par told R we were going to have one column with 2 rows, so it placed<br>
| this histogram in the top position.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|============================================================                       |  72%<br>
| Now, here's a challenge for you. Plot the histogram of the counties from the west using<br>
| just one R command. Let the appropriate subset command (with the pm25 portion specified)<br>
| be the first argument and col (equal to "green") the second.  To cut down on your typing,<br>
| use the up arrow key to get your last command and replace "east" with the subset command.<br>
| Make sure the boolean argument checks for equality between region and "west".</p>

<p>| You are really on a roll!</p>
<p>|=============================================================                      |  73%<br>
| See how R does all the labeling for you? Notice that the titles are different since we<br>
| used different commands for the two plots. Let's look at some scatter plots now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|==============================================================                     |  75%<br>
| Scatter plots are two-dimensional plots which show the relationship between two variables,<br>
| usually x and y. Let's look at a scatterplot showing the relationship between latitude and<br>
| the pm25 data. We'll use plot, a function from R's base plotting package.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>|===============================================================                    |  76%<br>
| We've seen that we can use a function call as an argument when calling another function.<br>
| We'll do this again when we call plot with the arguments latitude and pm25 which are both<br>
| from our data frame pollution. We'll call plot from inside the R command with which<br>
| evaluates "an R expression in an environment constructed from data". We'll use pollution<br>
| as the first argument to with and the call to plot as the second. This allows us to avoid<br>
| typing "pollution$" before the arguments to plot, so it saves us some typing and adds to<br>
| your base of R knowledge. Try this now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with(pollution,plot(latitude,pm25))</p>

<p>| You nailed it! Good job!</p>
<p>|================================================================                   |  77%<br>
| Note that the first argument is plotted along the x-axis and the second along the y. Now<br>
| use abline to add a horizontal line at 12. Use two additional arguments, lwd equal to 2<br>
| and lty also equal to 2. See what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>abline(h=12,lwd=2,lty=2)</p>

<p>| That's correct!</p>
<p>|=================================================================                  |  79%<br>
| See how lty=2 made the line dashed? Now let's replot the scatterplot. This time, instead<br>
| of using with, call plot directly with 3 arguments. The first 2 are pollution$latitude and  
| ppm. The third argument, col, we'll use to add color and more information to our plot. Set  
| this argument (col) equal to pollution$region and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>plot(pollution$latitude,ppm,col=pollution$region)</p>

| We've got two colors on the map to distinguish between counties in the east and those in<br>
